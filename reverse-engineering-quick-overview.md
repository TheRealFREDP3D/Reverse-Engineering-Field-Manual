## Introduction

Reverse engineering is the art of analyzing software or hardware to understand how it works without access to the original source code. In CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions, reverse engineering challenges often involve analyzing binaries to find flags or understand vulnerabilities.

## What is Reverse Engineering?

Reverse engineering involves:
- **Static Analysis**: Examining the code without executing it
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Running the program and observing its behavior
- **Binary Analysis**: Working with compiled executable files
- **Memory Analysis**: Examining runtime memory structures

## Step-by-Step Reverse Engineering Process

### Step 1: Initial Analysis
1. **File Identification**: Use `file` command to determine the binary type
2. **Strings Analysis**: Run `strings` to find hardcoded text and potential clues
3. **Check Protections**: Analyze security mechanisms (ASLR, NX, Stack Canaries)

### Step 2: Static Analysis
1. **Disassembly**: Use tools like Ghidra or IDA to convert binary to assembly
2. **Function Identification**: Locate main functions and interesting subroutines
3. **Code Analysis**: Understand program flow and logic

### Step 3: Dynamic Analysis
1. **Debugging**: Use GDB to step through execution
2. **Breakpoints**: Set breakpoints at critical functions
3. **Memory Inspection**: Examine registers and memory during execution

### Step 4: Vulnerability Identification
1. **Buffer Overflow Analysis**: Look for insecure function usage
2. **Input Validation**: Identify missing checks
3. **Control Flow**: Understand how user input affects execution

### Step 5: Exploit Development
1. **Payload Crafting**: Create input to trigger vulnerabilities
2. **Address Calculation**: Determine memory addresses for exploitation
3. **Testing**: Verify the exploit works reliably

## Essential Tools

### Static Analysis Tools
- **Ghidra**: Free open-source reverse engineering tool with decompiler
- **IDA Pro**: Professional disassembler and debugger
- **Radare2**: Command-line reverse engineering framework
- **Binary Ninja**: Modern reverse engineering platform

### Dynamic Analysis Tools
- **GDB**: GNU Debugger with extensions like GEF or Peda
- **strace**: Trace system calls and signals
- **ltrace**: Trace library calls
- **OllyDbg**: Windows debugger

### Development Tools
- **pwntools**: Python library for exploit development
- **ROPgadget**: Find ROP gadgets in binaries
- **checksec**: Check binary security features

## Tool Cheatsheets

### GDB Cheatsheet
```bash
# Basic commands
gdb ./binary          # Start GDB with binary
run                   # Run the program
break *0xAddress      # Set breakpoint at address
continue              # Continue execution
stepi                 # Step instruction
nexti                 # Next instruction
info registers        # Show register values
x/10x $rsp            # Examine 10 words at stack pointer
```

### Ghidra Cheatsheet
- **Import**: File → Import → Select binary
- **Analysis**: Auto-analysis will decompile code
- **Navigation**: Double-click functions to view decompiled code
- **Search**: Use Search → For Strings to find text
- **Comments**: Right-click to add analysis comments

### pwntools Cheatsheet
```python
from pwn import *

# Basic setup
context.binary = './binary'
context.log_level = 'debug'

# Remote connection
r = remote('host', port)
r.recvuntil('prompt: ')
r.sendline(payload)
r.interactive()

# Local process
p = process('./binary')
p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()

# Packing addresses
payload = b'A'*offset + p64(0xAddress)
```
