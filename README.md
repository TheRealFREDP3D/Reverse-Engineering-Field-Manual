# Reverse Engineering CTF Field Manual

A comprehensive collection of reverse engineering resources, guides, and exploit examples for CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions and security research.

## üìñ Contents

- **`reverse_engineering_field_guide.md`** - Detailed field guide covering reverse engineering techniques and methodologies
- **`reverse-engineering-quick-overview.md`** - Quick reference guide for common reverse engineering concepts
- **`Exploit/`** - Directory containing practical exploit examples
  - **`basic_buffer_overflow_exploit.py`** - Example buffer overflow exploit implementation

## üöÄ Getting Started

This repository contains educational materials for learning reverse engineering concepts. The content is organized for both beginners and experienced practitioners.

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with assembly language (x86/x64)
- Experience with debugging tools (GDB, WinDbg, etc.)
- Knowledge of common vulnerability types

### Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheRealFREDP3D/Reverse-Engineering-Field-Manual
   ```

2. Explore the markdown guides for theoretical concepts:
   - Start with `reverse-engineering-quick-overview.md` for a high-level overview
   - Dive deeper with `reverse_engineering_field_guide.md` for comprehensive coverage

3. Study the exploit examples in the `Exploit/` directory:
   - Analyze `basic_buffer_overflow_exploit.py` to understand buffer overflow vulnerabilities
   - Modify and test the exploits in controlled environments

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

The materials in this repository cover:
- Assembly language analysis
- Binary reverse engineering
- Memory corruption vulnerabilities
- Exploit development
