# Introduction to Reverse Engineering

Reverse engineering is the art of understanding how software works by examining it from the outside in. In cybersecurity and CTF competitions, reverse engineering challenges test your ability to analyze binaries, understand their functionality, and often find vulnerabilities or hidden flags.

This guide will take you from absolute beginner to having the fundamental skills needed to tackle most CTF reverse engineering challenges. We'll focus on practical, hands-on learning with real tools and techniques used by security professionals.

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Python programming knowledge (helpful but not required)
- Curiosity and patience!

## What is Reverse Engineering?

Reverse engineering in cybersecurity involves:

- **Understanding program behavior** without access to source code
- **Identifying vulnerabilities** that could be exploited
- **Extracting hidden information** like passwords or flags
- **Bypassing protections** or authentication mechanisms
- **Analyzing malware** to understand its functionality

### Common CTF Challenge Types
1. **Crackme challenges** - Find the correct password or bypass authentication
2. **Binary exploitation** - Find and exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities
3. **Flag extraction** - Locate hidden flags within binaries
4. **Algorithm reconstruction** - Understand and recreate program logic
5. **Anti-debugging bypasses** - Overcome protection mechanisms
